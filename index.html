          <br>Hey there, my name is Chau and I am currently in my first year of Arts at Monash University.
          <br>I have changed my majors many time and finally found the career that I want to pursue, which is full-stack/web development.
          <br>Right now I am working on freeCodeCamp, Dr. Angela Yu's "The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp" and The Odin Project to learn about full-stack development and will try to contribute as often as I can to my GitHub.
          <br>You can watch my growth here:
